Title: CMSSW IO for latency and usability

Contact: Brian Bockelman

Description: For several years, CMSSW has led the field in advanced
ROOT IO techniques; CMSSW has pioneered several ideas that have
been later incorporated into the base ROOT code. ROOT IO is the
serialization layer used by all of HEP; however, it is well-known
for having performance degradations over high latency. This project
will continue to improve the CMSSW IO layer on top of ROOT IO to
decrease latency sensitivity, contribute successful ideas into the
underlying ROOT software, and IO issues in CMSSW easier to debug.
We propose the following tasks: Validate the interaction between
ROOT prefetching code and CMSSW so this can be enabled by default;
port the DAVIX HTTP client into the CMSSW IO layer for improved
performance; implement the existing multisource algorithm into the
HTTP client; design and implement measurements of latency-sensitivity
and blocking that can be reported in every job; track the "redirection
history" (the list of all servers a client encountered) and report
this in failure messages, port the existing multisource algorithm
into an Xrootd client plugin; port various optimizations from CMSSW
IO layer to ROOT IO.

Skills Required: Strong C++ knowledge. Understanding of basic networking technologies.
